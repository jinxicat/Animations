"gridsearch_optimized_fft_extrapolation.py"

  Overview:
    -basic/novice approach to gridsearch optimization

  Possible Uses:
    -Use extrapolation techniques to remove time-gaps in large timeseires data sets. 
    -FFT extrapolation sequence as a Deep Learning feature column


"optimize.py"

  Overview:
    -Hyperopt optimization script
    -Bayesian optimization for multidimensional parameter spaces
    -Minimize the loss of the "Objective()" function 

  Uses:
    -Optimizing simulations
    -Optimize any function from the current context
    -Must create your own "Objective()" function
